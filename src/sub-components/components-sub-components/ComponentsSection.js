                <p>Building components is what React is based on. Without them we cannot use the word React. It is the building block, the brick, the foundation that allows us to create our app.</p>
                <p>Components have to be <em>pure</em>, they have to render the same output with the same input. Not being able to modify external variables. States can hep us with that.</p>
